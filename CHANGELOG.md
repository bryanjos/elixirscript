# v0.15.0-dev
* Enhancements
  * Now tracking environment scopes
  * `alias`, `require`, and `import` now work inside lexical scopes

  * Began writing some of the standard libraries in Elixir instead of JavaScript

# v0.14.1
* Enhancements
  * Removed .DS_Store and LICENSE from output

# v0.14.0
* Breaking
  * Renamed `ex2js` to `elixirscript`. This effects the escript as well as the
  mix task
* Enhancements
  * Structs are now translated into classes
  * Structs and Tuples now match on their types
  * Can now match on JavaScript classes. Works just like matching on structs:
  ```elixir
    def my_func(%HTMLElement{id: "myId"})
  ```
  * Can now implement protocols using JavaScript types
  ```elixir
    defimpl MyProtocol, for: HTMLElement
  ```
  * Added virtual-dom JavaScript library
  * Added ElixirScript.Html module for defining a virtual-dom tree
  * Added ElixirScript.VDom module for manipulating the virtual-dom tree created
  using the ElixirScript.Html module
  * Added ElixirScript.View module for handling view state and rendering virtual-dom
  * Added `stdlib_path` compiler option to specify the es6 path to the standard library.
  If used, elixir.js will not be exported with the compiled modules
  * Moved non-elixir JavaScript code into `core` es6 module. This will hopefully
  make it so ElixirScript Standard Library modules can be defined in Elixir soon.

# v0.6.5
* Enhancements
  * Now using the JS code generator from elixir-estree for code generation, improving speed of transpilation

# v0.6.0
  * Enhancements
    * Made the Tuple, Range and BitString data structures more immutable

    * Improved function chaining
    * added `from` clause to `import`, `alias`, and `require` so that the import path can be overridden
    * `alias` now acts like `require` in that it is translated into an import default statement
    * modules now export a default object with def functions added as properties on it.
    * for function closures, now calling by using `.call(this)` so that `this` is available inside of it

  * Enhancements
    * bitstrings
    * Better Pattern Matching (Does not support bitstrings yet)
